# General information

ProbCompCert ties directly into CompCert by generating Clight code and
makes heavy use of most of the generic compiler libraries of CompCert
including: Coqlib, Maps, Integers, Floats, Errors, AST, Linking,
Values, Memory, Globalenvs, Smallstep, Op, Ctypes, and Clight.

Documentation on these libraries can be found in [CompCert's commented
Coq development](https://compcert.org/doc/index.html)
