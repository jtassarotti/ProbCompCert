# General information

ProbCompCert ties directly into CompCert by generating Clight code and
makes heavy use of most of the generic compiler libraries of CompCert
including: Coqlib, Maps, Integers, Floats, Errors, AST, Linking,
Values, Memory, Globalenvs, Smallstep, Op, Ctypes, and Clight.

Documentation on these libraries can be found in [CompCert's commented
Coq development](https://compcert.org/doc/index.html)

The [runtime](runtime) directory contains the C implementation of the
runtime and of the standard library.

The [tests](tests) directory contains Stan example programs and
development tools.

## Languages, syntax and semantics:

Similar to CompCert, the compiler makes use of multiple languages. In
CompCert, to a large extent, every syntax is asscociated with a single
semantics, and a compiler pass that removes a feature maps to a new
language. An exception is Clight which comes with two semantics.

In ProbCompCert, at least for now, several compiler pass remain in the
same language despite removing a feature. As a result, some languages
are associated with multiple semantics.

* Stan: The Stan language, generated by the parser. This language is
  (or at least should be) faithful to the official Stan specification.

* Stanlight: A subset of Stan describing valid
   Stan programs. In principle, any Stan program could be written in
   Stanlight.

* CStan: Clight extended with an explicit target and a
  list of parameters and data variables. 

| Language | Syntax | Semantics | Notes |
| -------- | ------ | --------- | ----- |
| Stan     | [Stan](Stan.v)  |  | Does not currently have a formal semantics |
| Stanlight| [Stanlight](Stanlight.v) | [Ssemantics.v](Ssemantics.v) | Stanlight programs are valid Stan programs. |
| CStan    | [CStan](CStan.v) | [CStanSemanticsTarget](CStanSemanticsTarget.v) [CStanSemanticsBackend](CStanSemanticsBackend.v)| CStan programs use the C type system and global environment|

## Parsing

The parser uses Menhir's verified parsing tools. The verified parser
was largely developped by Brian Ward as part of his [honor's
thesis](https://www.bc.edu/content/dam/bc1/schools/mcas/cs/pdf/honors-thesis/Ward_Brian_Thesis.pdf)
at Boston College.

* [Lexer.mll](Lexer.mll): lexer specification
* [Parser.vy](Parser.vy): parser specification, in Coq Menhir
* [error.messages](error.messages): error messages

## Compiler passes

| Pass | Source | Target | Code | Proof |
| ---- | ------ | ------ | ---- | ----- |
| Implement sampling statement | Stanlight | Stanlight | [Sampling](Sampling.v) | [Samplingproof](Samplingproof.v) |
| Reparameterize constrained parameters | Stanlight | Stanlight | [Reparameterization](Reparameterization.v) | [Reparameterizationproof](Reparameterizationproof.v) |
| Pull calls out of expressions, compile for loops, translate types to C types, translate operators | Stanlight| CStan | [Clightification](Clightification.v) | [Clightificationproof](Clightificationproof.v) |
| Replace gloval parameters and data by structures | CStan | CStan | [AllocateVariables](AllocateVariables.v) | [AllocateVariablesproof](AllocateVariablesproof.v) |
| Explicit target | CStan | CStan | [Target](Target.v) | [Targetproof](Targetproof.v) |
| Generate Clight | CStan | Clight | [Sbackend](Sbackend.v) | [Sbackendproof](Sbackendproof.v) |

Notes:
* The stanlight to stanlight transformations need not preserve the smallstep operation semantics

## All together

* [Scompiler](Scompiler.v): defines the overall compilation and proof of semantics preservation
